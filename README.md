### Tweepy Data Mining, NLP, and Deep Learning
Purpose
- Learn Tweepy API (data mining), 
- Apply Natural Language Processing and text visualization
- Build Neural Network Models, save/load token and models
- 
Tasks
1. Setup tweepy, scape data, clean data, compute numeric visulization
2. Apply Natural Language Processing, text cleaning, visualization, word cloud, Named Entity Recognition (NER)
3. Build Neural Network Models, clean data, feature customization, parameter testing, visualization, store best model, confusion matrix
Conclusion

- From the tweets mined, android market share is nearly equal to apple products. Google has done well in increasing marketshare. 
- For startup to develop applications, expand in both android and apple is essential. The hybrid framework should have significant growth.
- It seems curcial to promote/advertise things within 1 week of event occuring.
- Neural Networks are extremely powerful having right parameters and features will minimize learning time. 
- In each step of Data Analysis process: cleaning, feature selection, feature calculation, parameter selection, dimention selection, every single detail is essential!
