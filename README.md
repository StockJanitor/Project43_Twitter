### Tweepy, NLP, and Deep Learning

Files: 1_Project43_Twitter, 2_rnnKerasLSTM, 3_reference <br>

Overview <br>
- Tweepy API (data mining)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP), EDA
- Build Neural Network Models

Conclusion <br>
- From the tweets mined, android market share is nearly equal to apple products. Google has done well in increasing marketshare. 
- For startup to develop applications, expand in both android and apple is essential. The hybrid framework should have significant growth.
- It seems curcial to promote/advertise things within 1 week of event occuring.
- Neural Networks are extremely powerful having right parameters and features will minimize learning time. 
- In each step of Data Analysis process: cleaning, feature selection, feature calculation, parameter selection, dimention selection, every single detail is essential!

Flaws <br>
- model created in 2_rnnKerasLSTM, the corpus might not include words in 1_Project43_Twitter.
- model need more tuning and feature adjustments
